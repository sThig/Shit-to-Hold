# Hold shift to check

this was fairly difficult even with just a bit of code, but for once I kinda got what was going on.  I'm flagging Wes's classes that I have trouble on and will redo them until I get it.  I'm still lost on the => syntax but I'm going to look it up...

Ah, I found it  [Here ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24900875/whats-the-meaning-of-an-arrow-formed-from-equals-greater-than-in-javas)

>This is an arrow function. Arrow functions are a short syntax, introduced by ECMAscript 6, that can be used similarly to the way you would use function expressions. In other words, you can often use them in place of expressions like function (foo) {...}. But they have some important differences. For example, they do not bind their own values of this (see below for discussion).

# TIL

* how to setup flags (kinda, I kinda get it)
* forEach made a lot more sense
* emphasis on querySelectorAll
